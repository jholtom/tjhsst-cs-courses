//Parallel - PThreads

A PThread -> Parallel Thread
Using threading built into the processors architecture to build parallel
programs without having to utilize multiple physical processors.

A PThread is more efficient way to build parallel programs
This is due to the multi-core and multithread design of many modern processors

They can execute the threads as part of a process to simulataneously compute
multiple things

SHM -> private memory ans well as shared memory in a thread.  This is done
through the /dev/shm/ device with an element for each process and allocation.
