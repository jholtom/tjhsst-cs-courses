Parallel Computing Telelearn

One of the major comparisons between the code is that there is a version
written in SSE assembly, which is incredibly ugly compared to some of the C
and CUDA/OpenCL code we and he used.  His 'CoreLoop' function for CUDA
operates similarly to ours in terms of calculating the mandelbrot set and
zooming it.  The major differences is that it uses the graphics card to
perform the calculations in parallel and at much greater speeds due to the
design of the card.  The only major code difference is that he uses a pallete
of colors to lookup how the mandelbrot set should be shaded whereas we
calculate it in the code by doing 1.0-(m*1.0/MAXITER).  Then there is the fact
that it was written using OpenMP for multiple cores and then again with CUDA
for the extra performance.
