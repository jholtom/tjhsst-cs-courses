Norvig uses contstraint propgation instead of the more heuristic algorithm we
use to attempt all of the possibilities while guessing which should work and
then backtracking when a possibility set folds itself out of existence.  Both
of the solutions use a search algorithm, however Norvig's constraint
propogation works by eliminating possibilities by searching over a set of the
neighbors of each square and then when there is only one possibility, filling
it in.
